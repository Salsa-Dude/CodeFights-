<h2>Sort by Height</h2>

<p>Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. <br>
 Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees.</p>
 <br>
 <strong>Example</strong>
 For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be <br>
 sortByHeight(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190].
