<h2>alternatingSums</h2>

<p>Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. <br>
The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on.<p>
<p>You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. <br>
Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.</p>
<br>
<strong>Example</strong>
For a = [50, 60, 60, 45, 70], the output should be <br>
alternatingSums(a) = [180, 105].
